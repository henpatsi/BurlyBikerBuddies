The Office:
I’m a simple guy. I hate The Office.

Meat:
You serve vegan T-bone here?
I wanna Tofu-hawk Steak!
You got a Filet Mignon, minus the meat?

Party:
I love that you have books here.
You mind if I bring my Hemingway with me? Keeps me comfy.

Peanuts:
Peanuts are for elephants

Harry Potter:
J.K. Rowling more like J.K… terrible!
My entire family was killed by wizards.

Felis catus is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.
I have 14 cats. Want one?
Meow.

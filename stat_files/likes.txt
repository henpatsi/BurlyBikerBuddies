Dolls:
“Doll” is just a fancy term for “action figure”.
Rapunzel is the only one missing from my collection.
I make all the clothes for my dolls by hand.

Meat:
You serve T-bone here?
I want a tomahawk steak!
You got a filet mignon, with extra meat?

Party:
YEAAAOOOOHHHHH WHERE’S THE KEG?!?!!!
WHERE CAN I LIGHT MY FACE ON FIRE? WEAAOOOUGHHH!
IS DANCING ALLOWED??! I LOVE DANCIN’!!!!

Peanuts:
A PBJ a day keeps the doctors at bay.
Mmrghbh- Sorry bout that! Couldn’t speak with all the nuts in my mouth.
No matter what I do, I can’t keep peanuts off my mind. I need help.

Harry Potter:
I’m looking for the Harry to my Potter.
I’m looking for the Ron to my Weasley.
I’m looking for the Professor to my Albus to my Dumbledore.

Dogs:
Dogs are dope I guess.
Woof! Woof! Rrrrrrrrrr! (Pees on your leg).
(Pants incessantly, salivating on your shoes. Looks like he wants a treat.)
